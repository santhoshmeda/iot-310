# Welcome to the IOT 310B: Internet of Things: Cloud Computing & Analytics

Data is the key to success in the internet of things. In this course you’ll get an overview of the various techniques used to visualize, present and utilize data effectively, so agents of the internet of things system can drive results. We’ll explore data flow, cleansing, processing and analysis, all of which are critical to producing a result worth investing in by the customer. You’ll take a deep dive on concepts such as distributed computing, storage and end-user client applications, all in the context of the cloud. We’ll concentrate on extracting value from the data collected from devices, and from other relevant data, to generate an event or result.

Topics include:

How to store, process, present and visualize data from the internet of things.
- Setting up microservices in the cloud, including data schema, database, API development and server elements
- Simple and complex visualization tools
- Analysis of datasets 

This course expects that you have taken either Course 1 or Course 2 (preferrably both) of the UW IoT Certification Course (or are familiar with programming and the RPi sensors).
